In contrast, **asynchronous updates** show attractor ratios spanning the full range, but SHD is generally much lower for low attractor ratio trajectories, increasing gradually up to **~40**, confirming that asynchronous dynamics produce more informative trajectories.\n",

In asynchronous updates, however, a downward trend in BDe can be observed for the atraktor_ratio range of 0.0-0.4. After that, most of the values ​​accumulate close to zero.\n",

    "We analyze the **mean lag-1 autocorrelation**, denoted `mean_lag1_acf`, which measures dependence between consecutive sampled time points. Lag 1 is chosen because it captures correlation between two adjacent time points.  \n",

    "For **synchronous update**, the distribution of `mean_lag1_acf` is centered close to zero across all sampling frequencies and network sizes. No systematic trend with respect to sampling frequency is observed. This behavior is expected, as synchronous dynamics define a deterministic mapping between states; subsampling does not substantially alter short-range temporal dependence.\n",

The non-monotonic behavior at higher sampling frequencies requires further statistical testing to assess significance.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Results: Effective Sample Size (ESS) \n",

    "#### Part 4. Does increasing sampling frequency significantly improve median reconstruction quality?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to assess whether **increasing the sampling frequency (sampling factor)** leads to **statistically significant changes in the median values of reconstruction quality metrics** for AHD and SID.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is conducted **exclusively for the asynchronous update mode**, as in the synchronous setting the descriptive results clearly indicate that the best reconstruction quality is achieved for **sampling factor equal to 1**, making further statistical comparisons unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "To isolate the effect of sampling frequency, all statistical tests are performed **within homogeneous experimental groups**, defined by the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* update mode,\n",
    "* score function,\n",
    "* number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each group, **paired comparisons** are performed between consecutive sampling factors (1→2, 2→3, 3→4, 4→5). The analysis considers two reconstruction quality metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* AHD,\n",
    "* SID,\n",
    "\n",
    "and two score functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* BDe,\n",
    "* MDL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical significance of median differences is assessed using the **single (greater) Wilcoxon signed-rank test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the experimental condition, the number of paired observations equals **900, 1800, or 3600**, which allows the applied tests to be considered as having **high statistical power**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are summarized in a heatmap that presents:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the median difference between consecutive sampling factors,\n",
    "* statistical significance levels for each comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For **BDe**, a **statistically significant improvement in reconstruction quality is observed for the transition from sampling factor 2 to 3**, indicating a meaningful change in the ranking of graph structures induced by this cost function. No further gains are observed for higher sampling factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, when using **MDL**, statistically significant differences are observed only for the  transition from **sampling factor 1 to 2**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, these effects reflect changes in the **values of the cost functions used to rank candidate graph structures**, rather than direct improvements in the reconstruction metrics themselves. The observed differences may arise from BDe and MDL different construction, and usage of prior information from BDe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Recommended configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the obtained results, the following recommendations can be formulated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **synchronous**:\n",
    "  the optimal sampling factor is **3** (part 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BDe (asynchronous)**:\n",
    "  the optimal sampling factor is **3**, we show that changes in direction (1-2-3) significantly increase reconstruction quality (AHD, SID). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **MDL (asynchronous)**:\n",
    "  the optimal sampling factor is **2**, we show that changes in direction (1-2) significantly increase reconstruction quality (AHD, SID). \n",
    "\n",
    "Higher sampling factors does not bring any differences, to reconstruction quality, it may only reduce them. "

    "#### Part 1: ESS and ACF vs Sampling Frequency \n",
    "\n",
    "This section analyzes how sampling frequency affects temporal dependence in the generated datasets. We focus on two diagnostics:\n",
    "* lag-1 autocorrelation (ACF),\n",
    "* effective sample size (ESS).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "We analyze the **mean lag-1 autocorrelation**, denoted `mean_lag1_acf`, which measures dependence between consecutive sampled time points. Lag 1 is chosen because it captures correlation between two adjacent time points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ESS is computed to quantify the amount of effectively independent information contained in the sampled trajectories. Higher ESS should bring more information to model training and improve reconstruction quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Results: Lag-1 Autocorrelation (ACF)\n",
    "\n",
    "For **synchronous update**, the distribution of `mean_lag1_acf` is centered close to zero across all sampling frequencies and network sizes. No systematic trend with respect to sampling frequency is observed. This behavior is expected, as synchronous dynamics define a deterministic mapping between states; subsampling does not substantially alter short-range temporal dependence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **asynchronous update**, we observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a clear decrease in lag-1 autocorrelation when increasing sampling frequency from 1 to 3,\n",
    "* a weaker but still noticeable change between frequencies 1 and 4,\n",
    "* a potential degradation or saturation between frequencies 4 and 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations suggest that subsampling reduces short-range dependence in asynchronous trajectories up to a point, beyond which additional subsampling start to increase ACF. The non-monotonic behavior at higher sampling frequencies requires further statistical testing to assess significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Results: Effective Sample Size (ESS) \n",
    "\n",
    "For **synchronous update**, ESS increases clearly with sampling frequency across all network sizes. This indicates that subsampling effectively reduces redundancy in deterministic dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "For **asynchronous update**, the pattern is less clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ESS values are substantially lower than in the synchronous case,\n",
    "* increases in sampling frequency do not translate into uniform gains in ESS,\n",
    "* ESS appears to depend jointly on sampling frequency and network size.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that stochastic update dynamics introduce long-range temporal correlations that are not fully mitigated by simple subsampling. s a result, sampling frequency alone is insufficient to ensure an increase in ESS in asynchronous trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conclusion\n",
    "For both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** update there is no clear relation between ESS and ACF. In next parts we will need to examine them independently. "

    "\n",
    "For the **synchronous update mode**, a clear pattern is observed in both reconstruction metrics.\n",

    "As shown in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AHD vs sampling frequency** plots (top row, synchronous panels),\n",

    "we observe that reconstruction quality generally improves when increasing sampling frequency from 1 to approximately 3. Beyond this point improvement become inconsistent across network sizes and score functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lack of monotonicity indicates that, in the asynchronous case, the relationship between sampling frequency and reconstruction quality is mediated by additional factors, such as long-range temporal dependence and network size. Consequently, inferential statistical tests are required to assess the significance of these trends.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We find a clear relationship between **sampling frequency** and **model reconstruction quality**, but this relationship is different for synchronous and asynchronous case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For **synchronous dynamics**, the optimal choice is **sampling frequency = 1**, as any subsampling leads to a consistent loss of structural and causal accuracy.\n",
    "* For **asynchronous dynamics**, reconstruction quality generally improves with subsampling up to a moderate frequency (around 3), but no single optimal value can be identified without further statistical testing."

    "\n",
    "For **BDe**, a **statistically significant improvement in reconstruction quality is observed for the transition from sampling factor 2 to 3**, indicating a meaningful change in the ranking of graph structures induced by this cost function. No further gains are observed for higher sampling factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, when using **MDL**, statistically significant differences are observed only for the  transition from **sampling factor 1 to 2**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, these effects reflect changes in the **values of the cost functions used to rank candidate graph structures**, rather than direct improvements in the reconstruction metrics themselves. The observed differences may arise from BDe and MDL different construction, and usage of prior information from BDe.\n",

    "Based on the obtained results, the following recommendations can be formulated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **synchronous**:\n",
    "  the optimal sampling factor is **3** (part 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BDe (asynchronous)**:\n",
    "  the optimal sampling factor is **3**, we show that changes in direction (1-2-3) significantly increase reconstruction quality (AHD, SID). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **MDL (asynchronous)**:\n",
    "  the optimal sampling factor is **2**, we show that changes in direction (1-2) significantly increase reconstruction quality (AHD, SID). \n",
    "\n",
    "Higher sampling factors does not bring any differences, to reconstruction quality, it may only reduce them. "
